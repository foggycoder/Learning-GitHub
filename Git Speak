# Fits for Gits

## Fit the First - Terms
Git software never casts aspertions,
It merely controls your many versions.
When you want to "Collaborate"
You need to find a willing mate.
Recently I've learnt some Bash,
But now I know the alpha-number "Hash".
And the strange long word, "Repository"
Is part of another cool new story.

## Fit the Second - Branches
Just like a real live tree (but on it's side)
"Branches" spread the idea far and wide
And when it's time to "Merge" from twain
A "Pull Request" will spot the pain
If any "Conflict" should appear.
Confused about the tree? Then let's be clear -
Click on the Insights tab up at the top
And choose the Network option from the drop
