Fits for Gits

FIT THE FIRST - TERMS
Git software never casts aspertions,
It merely controls your many versions.
When you want to "Collaborate"
You need to find a willing mate.
Recently I've learnt some Bash,
But now I know the alpha-number "Hash".
And the strange long word, "Repository"
Is part of another cool new story.

FIT THE SECOND...
