# Learning-GitHub
This is my first repository. I'm learning using "The Coding Train" YouTube tutorials. It's a poem. Composing the poem forces you to think about what you've learnt from the videos.<br><br>
It is Stephen Fry's opinion (expressed in his book "The Ode Less Travelled") that, to truly enjoy your own poetry, you should never subject it to public scrutiny. Well, this poem is going to be Public, so "here goes".
Actually, even though this is open to Public collaboration, I shall be very surprised if anyone from the vast Github metaverse turns up to work on this with me. Surprised, but pleasantly surprised.<br><br>
The idea of "Fits" comes (to me, at least) from Douglas Adams' "The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy". "Fits" were episodes of the radio play.
